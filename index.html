    <h2>Real Impact: Meet Amina</h2>

        <p>
          Amina used to walk several miles every single day just to collect water for her family. The water she gathered was often dirty and unsafe, which caused frequent illnesses for her children and made daily life very difficult. Because of the time and effort spent fetching water, Amina’s children often missed school and could not fully enjoy their childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, thanks to your generous support, charity: water was able to build a clean water well right in her village. Now, Amina and her family have easy access to safe, clean water just steps from their home. This has made a huge difference in their lives—Amina’s children can attend school regularly, stay healthy, and dream about a brighter future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amina herself feels relieved and hopeful, as she no longer has to worry about where her next drink of water will come from. Your contribution has truly transformed their community, bringing health, happiness, and new opportunities to Amina and her loved ones.
